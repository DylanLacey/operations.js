operations.js
=============
A library for managing complex chains of asynchronous operations in Javascript. 

Libraries such as async.js are awesome, but when attempting to define complex dependencies between your asynchronous callbacks things can quickly get out of hand. 

Inspired by the cocoa NSOperation and NSOperationQueue classes by Apple, this library is my attempt to solve this problem.
