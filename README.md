operations.js
=============
A library for managing complex chains of asynchronous operations in Javascript. 

Libraries such as async.js are awesome, but when attempting to define complex dependencies between your asynchronous callbacks things can quickly get out of hand. 

Inspired by the NSOperation and NSOperationQueue classes in Apple's Cocoa framework, this library is an attempt to solve this problem.

### Examples
